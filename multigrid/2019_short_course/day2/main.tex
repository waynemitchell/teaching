\begin{block}{Moving from basic iterative methods to multigrid}

\item Focus on a model elliptic PDE problem
\item Examine the behavior of basic iterative methods on this problem
\item Use that behavior to motivate the move towards multigrid

\begin{block}{Model problem: Poisson}
\bit
\item Classic model problem is a simple Poisson problem with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions:
\eq{
\Delta u &= f, & \Omega \\
u &= 0, & \partial \Omega
}
\item Discretizing with finite differences on a regular 1D mesh:
\eit
\eq{
&\frac{-u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1}}{h^2} = f_i, & i = 1,2,..., N\\
&u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0

% Review of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and describe them for the model problem. Symmetric problem, evecs are a basis.
% Write error reduction as a decomposition into the evecs (the fourier modes in the case of the model problem)


% Slide
\begin{frame}{Basic iterative methods and a model problem}
\begin{block}{Review of eigenvalues and eigenvectors}
\bit
\item Eigenvalues, $\lambda$, and eigenvectors, $v$, of a matrix, $A$, are defined by
\eq{Av = \lambda v}
\item Evals and evecs can be a way to think about ``action" of an operator: rotation and scaling
\item Important in many applications from physics and engineering

\begin{block}{Review of eigenvalues and eigenvectors}
\bit
\item If $A$ is symmetric positive definite (SPD), then eigenvectors form a basis for $\mathcal{R}^n$
\item Thus, any vector, $x\in\mathcal{R}^n$ can be decomposed as 
\item We can study behavior of iterative methods by considering their effect on different eigenvectors

% Introduce weighted Jacobi
% Look at behavior of weighted Jacobi on fourier modes. Note stalling convergence on smooth modes.
% Definition of "smoothing factor" and motivation for weighted Jacobi as a smoother
% Visualize some 1D examples to show qualitatively how things are smoothed out

\section{Towards multigrid}


% Observation 1: smooth error is relatively oscillatory on a coarser grid
% Observation 2: use of the residual equation on the coarse grid
% Result: coarse grid correction
% Define interpolation
% Define restriction
% Define 2 grid
% Define MG cycles
% Cost of MG: count up the operations to get compute cost

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Some basic convergence theory}


% Two grid convergence
% multilevel?
% FMG convergence to discretization accuracy

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Other stuff?}

% 2D examples, anisotropic examples with line smoothing and semicoarsening
% Use of MG as preconditioner for Krylov methods
