\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{block}{Benefits and limitations of geometric multigrid (GMG)}
\bit
\item Solution of many PDEs to discretization accuracy with optimal $O(N)$ cost
\item Multigrid components depend on geometry and discretization:
\bit
\item Coarsening
\item Interpolation and restriction
\item Definition of coarse-grid problems
\eit
\item Unclear how to proceed with unstructured meshes (TODO figure?)
\item Not applicable for problems with no underlying PDE or geometry
\eit
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{block}{Goals of algebraic multigrid (AMG)}
\bit
\item Construct an effective multigrid hierarchy given only a matrix system $A\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{f}$
\item Agnostic to underlying PDE and discretization
\item More of a ``black box" than GMG
\eit
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{block}{GMG vs. AMG}
\bit
\item GMG:
\bit
\item Grids and interpolation dictated by discretization/geometry
\item Need to find appropriate smoother for the problem
\eit
\item AMG:
\bit
\item Relaxation method is 
\item Construct coarsenings and interpolation constructed based on matrix entries
\eit
\eit
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{block}{Main approaches to AMG}
\bit
\item Use of simple pointwise smoothers (weighted Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel)
\item ``Algebraic smoothness" rather than geometric smoothness
\item Strength of connection between points determined by matrix entries
\eit
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{block}{Flavors of AMG}
\bit
\item ``Classical" or Ruge-St\"uben AMG
\bit
\item Split grid into C- and F-points
\item Interpolation to F-points based on matrix connections to C-point neighbors
\eit
\item Smoothed aggregation (SA)
\bit
\item Fine-grid points grouped and treated as single points on coarse grid
\item Interpolation based on splitting smooth vectors over aggregates
\eit

\end{block}

% Unstructured grids, etc. that are difficult for GMG
% "Black box" but not really
