\section{Motivation and model problems}

% Slide
\begin{frame}{Motivation and model problems}
\begin{block}{In this section}
\bit
\item General scientific computing a simulation and where large sparse linear systems come from
\item Model Poisson problem
\item Properties of matrix coming from Poisson (i.e. SPD... anything else?) and assumptions (for now) on the matrices we'll be using in general
\item Methods for solving linear systems: direct vs. iterative, optimal complexity, the need for efficient solvers
\eit
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation and model problems}
\begin{block}{Scientific computing}
\bit
\item The three pillars of science: theory, experiments, and \emph{simulation}
\item Computation can allow study of physical phenomena that are difficult, expensive, or infeasible to study with experiments
\item More computational power and more sophisticated algorithms enable more complicated simulations with better accuracy
\eit
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation and model problems}
\begin{block}{Simulation pipeline}
\bit
\item Physical phenomenon (potential field)
\item Continuous equations (Poisson's equation)
\item Discrete problem formulation (finite difference method)
\item Form discrete system of equations (meshing)
\only<1>{\item Solve the discrete system (linear/non-linear solvers)}
\only<2>{\item \textbf{Solve the discrete system (linear/non-linear solvers)}}
\eit
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation and model problems}
\begin{block}{Large, sparse linear systems}
\bit
\item Resulting linear systems tend to be large and sparse
\item Size (and conditioning) of the system depends on mesh resolution
\item Solving these linear systems is often a computational bottleneck
\item Want solvers to be:
\bit
\item Efficient (as problem grows, execution time does not suffer)
\item Robust (as conditioning gets worse, convergence does not suffer)

\begin{frame}{Motivation and model problems}
\begin{block}{Model problem: Poisson}
\bit
\item Classic model problem is a simple Poisson problem with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions:
\eq{
\Delta u &= f, & \Omega \\
u &= 0, & \partial \Omega
}
\item Discretizing with finite differences on a regular 1D mesh:
\eit
\eq{
&\frac{-u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1}}{h^2} = f_i, & i = 1,2,..., N\\
&u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0
}
