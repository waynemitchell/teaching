Day 1:


iterativeMethods:

1D model problem:
Show Jacobi step by step
Show Jacobi oscillating back and forth. Motivate weighted Jacobi.
Show that on the model problem, weighted Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel smooth the error.
Show that even for a non-smooth solution, the error is smooth.


Random matrix:
Show divergence of methods, then restored convergence when you enforce diagonal dominance



krylovMethods:






Day 2:


towardsMultigrid:

Plot some eigenvectors of the model problem

Convergence of weighted Jacobi on different eigenvectors:
Weight 1: slow for small and large k
Weight 2/3: slow only for small k

Convergence on the coarse grid problem:
Example mode that is slow on the fine grid and fast on the coarse grid

Jacobi with random solution, zero initial guess:
Quick initial convergence followed by stagnation
Smooth error despite oscillatory solution


geometricMultigrid:

1D Poisson

2D Poisson 

Anisotropic diffusion


Day 3:

amgCoarsening:
use PyAMG... use MY fork of PyAMG because it has standard interpolation???


amg:



Day 4:

Newton:
Visualize Newton's method for nonlinear problems. Show case where you start outside basin of attraction.
Can I code up a simple FAS scheme for a non-linear problem?

Non-symmetric:
Maybe switch to hypre/mfem for these examples... that way you can use AIR, have more control over problem, etc.


Graphs:
Check if LAMG is available somewhere? Or Aly's Julia code?


Day 5:
Also maybe want to go to hypre for examples here? PyAMG does have HMIS coarsening, etc...
