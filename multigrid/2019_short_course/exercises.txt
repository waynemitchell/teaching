Day 1:

iterativeMethods:

1D model problem:
Show Jacobi step by step
Show Jacobi oscillating back and forth. Motivate weighted Jacobi.
Show that on the model problem, weighted Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel smooth the error.
Show that even for a non-smooth solution, the error is smooth.

Random matrix:
Show divergence of methods, then restored convergence when you enforce diagonal dominance

krylovMethods:

Show level curves
Show gradient descent vs. CG
Show CG vs. PCG

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 2:

towardsMultigrid:

Plot some eigenvectors of the model problem

Convergence of weighted Jacobi on different eigenvectors:
Weight 1: slow for small and large k
Weight 2/3: slow only for small k

Convergence on the coarse grid problem:
Example mode that is slow on the fine grid and fast on the coarse grid

Jacobi with random solution, zero initial guess:
Quick initial convergence followed by stagnation
Smooth error despite oscillatory solution



geometricMultigrid:

1D Poisson

2D Poisson 

Anisotropic diffusion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 3:

amgCoarsening:
show isotropic and anisotropic, FD and FE

amg:
can print operators on different levels
show semicoarsening for a few levels followed by standard coarsening once anisotropy is overcome


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 4:

Newton:
Visualize Newton's method for nonlinear problems. 
Show case where you start outside basin of attraction.
Show case where derivative is zero.
Show case of starting point leading to a cycle: wikipedia: f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 2 start at 0

FAS:
Can I code up a simple FAS scheme for a non-linear problem?

Non-symmetric:
Maybe switch to hypre/mfem for these examples... that way you can use AIR, have more control over problem, etc.

Graphs:
Check if LAMG is available somewhere? Or Aly's Julia code?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 5:

Just use your AMG-DD driver to show some behavior of hypre and AMG-DD:
Show falgout with standard interp in 2D vs. 3D
Show:
   falgout coarsening vs. HMIS 
   with/without extended+i interpolation 
   with/without p-max.

Large AMG-DD composite grids for falgout coarsening

Large AMG-DD composite grids when padding is large (tie back to importance of minimizing ghost dofs)
