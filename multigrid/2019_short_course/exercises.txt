Day 1:


iterativeMethods:

1D model problem:
Show Jacobi step by step
Show Jacobi oscillating back and forth. Motivate weighted Jacobi.
Show that on the model problem, weighted Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel smooth the error.
Show that even for a non-smooth solution, the error is smooth.


Random matrix:
Show divergence of methods, then restored convergence when you enforce diagonal dominance



krylovMethods:






Day 2:


towardsMultigrid:

Plot some eigenvectors of the model problem

Convergence of weighted Jacobi on different eigenvectors:
Weight 1: slow for small and large k
Weight 2/3: slow only for small k

Convergence on the coarse grid problem:
Example mode that is slow on the fine grid and fast on the coarse grid

Jacobi with random solution, zero initial guess:
Quick initial convergence followed by stagnation
Smooth error despite oscillatory solution
