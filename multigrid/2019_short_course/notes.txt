--------------------------


Day 1: 
Maybe during exercises:
For Jacobi and GS, note their performance on different Fourier modes for the model problem. Foreshadow the MG: methods do a good job of reducing certain modes.


Day 2:
Session 1: 
Story: recall the iterative methods from Day 1. Review performance of Jacobi/GS on the Fourier modes. Use this to motivate MG.
